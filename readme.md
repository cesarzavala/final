Description

(This started as the P4 repository but then moved to this repository)

Merge/watermark pictures with the Harvard Summer School logo. The idea is that you take a picture of you and another Summer School friend and this app will have a series of 'frames', which are pictures with transparency, and will merge those pictures.

It will merge them without asking for login. If you register

you can save your pictures in the server
you can upload your own frames
Project according to the specs of Project 4.
